            <h1>The Fantasy Basketball Calculator</h1>
            <p>The purpose of this site was to give Fantasy Basketball players some extra info using ratings calculated from the relative value against all rostered players. A "0" in a category would mean the player is average in the category. Using this, we can see that a team approaching "0" in their team total is ranked middle of the pack in the league. It's just a tighter indicator to tell what your really getting with a player for any particular stat that's based on the players rostered so the values adjust as teams and rosters increase or shrink.</p>
